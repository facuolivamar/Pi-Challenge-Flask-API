		"description": "# üöÄ Get started here\n\nThis collection guides you through CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), variables, and tests.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Flask API requests to the \"/character\" endpoint, you can read the description of the [Character folder](https://www.postman.com/payload-geologist-60335199/workspace/challenge-python-interview/folder/33219531-60f23cf8-4be8-4ed2-b2c7-d97b2adb0016?ctx=documentation).\n\n## üîñ **How to use this collection**\n\n#### **Step 1: Send requests**\n\nRESTful APIs allow you to perform CRUD operations using the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.\n\nThis collection contains each of these request types. Open each request and click \"Send\" to see what happens.\n\n#### **Step 2: View responses**\n\nObserve the response tab for status code (200 OK), response time, and size.\n\n#### **Step 3: Send new Body data**\n\nUpdate or add new data in \"Body\" in the POST request. Typically, Body data is also used in PUT and PATCH requests.\n\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"Add your name in the body\"\n}\n\n ```\n\n#### **Step 4: Update the variable**\n\nVariables enable you to store and reuse values in Postman. We have created a variable called `base_url` with the sample request [https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me](https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me). Replace it with your API endpoint to customize this collection.\n\n#### **Step 5: Add tests in the \"Tests\" tab**\n\nTests help you confirm that your API is working as expected. You can write test scripts in JavaScript and view the output in the \"Test Results\" tab.\n\n<img src=\"https://content.pstmn.io/b5f280a7-4b09-48ec-857f-0a7ed99d7ef8/U2NyZWVuc2hvdCAyMDIzLTAzLTI3IGF0IDkuNDcuMjggUE0ucG5n\">\n\n## üí™ Pro tips\n\n- Use folders to group related requests and organize the collection.\n- Add more scripts in \"Tests\" to verify if the API works as expected and execute flows.\n    \n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Resources\n\n[Building requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/)  \n[Authorizing requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/)  \n[Using variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/)  \n[Managing environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/)  \n[Writing scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/intro-to-scripts/)",

			"description": "This is the Character folder.\n\nOnce your Flask API is running, you can perform the following actions:\n\n1. Get character:\n    1. returns a single character based on its ID\n2. Get character list\n    1. returns a list containing all the characters of the database\n3. Post Character\n    1. inserts a new character in the database\n4. Delete character\n    \n    1. remove a single character based on its ID\n        \n\nI recommend that you first check the port where your Flask API is running and modify the base_url_port variable in the \"Flask - Local\" environment with the appropriate value.\n\nIf you don't know how to run your Flask API, you can read the README.me file in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/facuolivamar/Pi-Challenge-Flask-API.git), or run the following Docker commands in the main directory:\n\n1. docker build -t challenge-python-flask-api .\n2. docker run -dp 5000:5000 challenge-python-flask-api (run in the background)"
